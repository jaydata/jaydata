**Update October 13, 2015** - JayStack receives **massive investment** to **boost JayData product development** and offer more premium services! http://bit.ly/jayfunding

JayData is a unified data access library for JavaScript to CRUD data from different sources like WebSQL/SQLite,
IndexedDB, MongoDb, ASP.NET WebAPI, OData, HTML5 localStorage, Facebook or YQL.
The library can be integrated with KendoUI, Knockout.js, Handlebars.js or Sencha Touch 2 and can be used on
Node.js as well.

JayData not only provides JavaScript Language Query (JSLQ) syntax to access local (in-browser and mobile)
and remote databases, but builds the queries and executes/processes the requests of the essential data
sources and data services to make developers able to concentrate only on the business logic.

Microsoft .NET developers can utilize Entity Framework and LINQ on server-side to perform operations on
data from different databases. The aim of JayData library is to give a similar tool to JavaScript developers.

JayData is cross-platform (runs on HTML5 desktop and mobile browsers, can be hosted in PhoneGap environment
on iPhone, iPad, Android or Windows Phone 8+) and cross-layer as it works on client-side and server-side (Node.JS).

Please read the release notes for current status of the providers.
